function [C] = hydrostaticRestoringMatrix(pm,g,p,model,face)
% A 6x6 matrix describing the body's hydrostatic restoring force
%
% The matrix C is made up of the terms where
% pointMasses is the matrix of [mjs,pjs]
% mj is the jth point mass
% pj is the position vector of the jth point mass (xj,yj,zj)
% g is the acceleration due to gravity
% p is the water density
% model is a meshed pdemodel
% face is the face number of the waterplane on the model's geometry
% center of gravity, Cg is [xg,yg,zg]
% center of buoyancy, Cb is [xb,yb,zb]
% m is the total glider's mass

% This is from a textbook where it is assumed that the origin is the center
%  of flotation which it very much is not as currently defined
